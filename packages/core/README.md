# @digitalacorn/vite-plugin-svg-icons

Please Note: this is a personal fork of [vite-plugin-svg-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-svg-icons)

Only created so I can proceed using the feature to disable the replacement of all stroke colours with currentColour.

Unless you need this specific feature it is recommended that you use the original package. This package will be deprecated once the [Pull Request](https://github.com/vbenjs/vite-plugin-svg-icons/pull/68) is accepted by the current maintainer.
